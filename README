1) Add yourself to the flatpak and input groups. 
2) Run the file install.sh (it will call the flatpak.sh and the flatpak.sh will call the packages.sh file.
3) The packages.sh file will launch the fedora ML4W installer, run it, and IGNORE THE ERRORS! 
   Set your dotfiles location, if you wish or if you want main or rolling release. 
   DO NOT REBOOT YET WHEN IT ASKS YOU TOO. 


NOTES:

       Run the sddm.sh file only if you installed OpenSUSE in server mode (Text Mode). If you installed plasma alongside Hyprland, don't run it.
       The file changes the run level from 3 to 5 and enables SDDM.

       Mission Center may fail to install due to a repo issue I have no control over that.

       I do not have an NVIDIA Card. I CANNOT help with that, sorry.

Known Issues:

the custom.conf disables kitty shell integration, as kitty runs in 
I believe POSIX Mode applies to Bash only, and ohmyposh refuses to run in this mode.

The Modules.json will allow you to see how many updates zypper has, like in Arch. I find it to be off as to how many updates it has, though. I took that module from SUSE default sway config.

The gnome polkit path is different in OpenSUSE; the line in autostart.conf should be:

exec-once = /usr/libexec/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
